## Overview

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://scatterplot-graph.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. 

**User Story #1:** I can see a title element that has a corresponding id="title". <br>
**User Story #2:** I can see an x-axis that has a corresponding id="x-axis". <br>
**User Story #3:** I can see a y-axis that has a corresponding id="y-axis". <br>
**User Story #4:** I can see dots, that each have a class of dot, which represent the data being plotted. <br>
**User Story #5:** Each dot should have the properties data-xvalue and data-yvalue containing their corresponding x and y values. <br>
**User Story #6:** The data-xvalue and data-yvalue of each dot should be within the range of the actual data and in the correct data format. For data-xvalue, integers (full years) or Date objects are acceptable for test evaluation. For data-yvalue (minutes), use Date objects. <br>
**User Story #7:** The data-xvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis. <br>
**User Story #8:** The data-yvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis. <br>
**User Story #9:** I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with %M:%S time format. <br>
**User Story #10:** I can see multiple tick labels on the x-axis that show the year. <br>
**User Story #11:** I can see that the range of the x-axis labels are within the range of the actual x-axis data. <br>
**User Story #12:** I can see that the range of the y-axis labels are within the range of the actual y-axis data. <br>
**User Story #13:** I can see a legend containing descriptive text that has id="legend". <br>
**User Story #14:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. <br>
**User Story #15:** My tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-xvalue of the active area. <br>

## My process

I started from writing a basic HTML structure and choosing a design style and fonts. Then I fetched the data, and coded the chart.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- D3.js

### What I learned

How to create bar charts in D3.js, how to use scales, text, and assign various attributes.

### Useful resources
