## Overview

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://heat-map.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. 

**User Story #1:** My heat map should have a title with a corresponding id="title". <br>
**User Story #2:** My heat map should have a description with a corresponding id="description". <br>
**User Story #3:** My heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis". <br>
**User Story #4:** My heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis". <br>
**User Story #5:** My heat map should have rect elements with a class="cell" that represent the data. <br>
**User Story #6:** There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells. <br>
**User Story #7:** Each cell will have the properties data-month, data-year, data-temp containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values. <br>
**User Story #8:** The data-month, data-year of each cell should be within the range of the data. <br>
**User Story #9:** My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis. <br>
**User Story #10:** My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis. <br>
**User Story #11:** My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name. <br>
**User Story #12:** My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015. <br>
**User Story #13:** My heat map should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend". <br>
**User Story #14:** My legend should contain rect elements. <br>
**User Story #15:** The rect elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors. <br>
**User Story #16:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. <br>
**User Story #17:** My tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-year of the active area. <br>

## My process

I started from writing a basic HTML structure and choosing a design style and fonts. Then I fetched the data, and coded the chart.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- D3.js

### What I learned

How to create bar charts in D3.js, how to use scales, text, and assign various attributes.
