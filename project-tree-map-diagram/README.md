## Overview

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://treemap-diagram.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. 

**User Story #1:** My tree map should have a title with a corresponding id="title". <br>
**User Story #2:** My tree map should have a description with a corresponding id="description". <br>
**User Story #3:** My tree map should have rect elements with a corresponding class="tile" that represent the data. <br>
**User Story #4:** There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles. <br>
**User Story #5:** Each tile should have the properties data-name, data-category, and data-value containing their corresponding name, category, and value. <br>
**User Story #6:** The area of each tile should correspond to the data-value amount: tiles with a larger data-value should have a bigger area. <br>
**User Story #7:** My tree map should have a legend with corresponding id="legend". <br>
**User Story #8:** My legend should have rect elements with a corresponding class="legend-item". <br>
**User Story #9:** The rect elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors. <br>
**User Story #10:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. <br>
**User Story #11:**  My tooltip should have a data-value property that corresponds to the data-value of the active area. <br>

## My process

I started from writing a basic HTML structure and choosing a design style and fonts. Then I fetched the data, and coded the chart.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- D3.js

### What I learned

How to create bar charts in D3.js, how to use scales, text, and assign various attributes.
